        <h1>An attempt at a poem</h1>
        <p class="poem">
            Roses are red, violets are blue,<br>
            My world seems brighter, all thanks to of you <br>
            Your smile, your laughter, your beautiful heart,<br>
            I cherish you deeply, never to part <br>
            <br>
            Just three months ago, our paths aligned <br>
            A spark was lit, so warm, so kind <br>
            Though miles apart on your special day, <br>
            I wish I'd be with you — never away <br>
            <br>
            Tomorrow I’ll see you, hold you near, <br>
            Whisper sweet words, just in you to hear <br>
            On your birthday, I send my love your way,<br>
            Wishing you happiness, today and always! 🎂🥰##
